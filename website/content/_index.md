This is a list of [rule groups](https://help.obdev.at/littlesnitch/lsc-rule-group-subscriptions) of blacklisted hosts you can subscribe to from [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) version 4.1 onwards.

These groups are generated from the raw host files on Steven Black's [unified hosts project](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

_Disclaimer: I make no claims or warranty for the veracity or accuracy of any of the source lists. In particular categorising something as "fake news" may be a matter of opinion. I just want to make them easier to consume from Little Snitch. I am not a lawyer. Use these at your own risk. You can always explicitly override false positives._
